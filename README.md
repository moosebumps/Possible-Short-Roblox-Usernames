## Information

This repository is a collection of possible and approved permutations of 3 and 4 letter usernames that exist and will soon to exist on Roblox.

The files in this repository include letters A to Z, numbers 0 to 9, and underscore. There are two versions for each username length: Possible names, and allowed names. 

### [3-Letter-Permutations](https://github.com/moosebumps/Possible-Short-Roblox-Usernames/blob/main/3%20Letter%20Permutations.txt)

There are 50,653 entries in this file with 198 KB worth of usernames. This may be a little bit slow to open, but it should be okay. But for slow computers open it in [raw form](https://github.com/moosebumps/Possible-Short-Roblox-Usernames/raw/main/3%20Letter%20Permutations.txt).

### [3-Letter-Allowed-Permutations](https://github.com/moosebumps/Possible-Short-Roblox-Usernames/blob/main/3%20Letter%20Allowed%20Permutations.txt)

### [4-Letter-Permutations](https://github.com/moosebumps/Possible-Short-Roblox-Usernames/blob/main/4%20Letter%20Permutations.txt)

With 1,874,161 combination entries, this monster of a file has about 17MB of potential and current usernames. You might need to download this file and open it in WordPad for it to open.

## Resources
This video was very helpful on explaining [Heap's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm) and how it is calculated in JavaScript. I used this Algorithm to help me calculate the Roblox usernames. Shoutout to [Justin Kim](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustinKimJS) for this video!

If you want to see if one of the usernames works, then I would suggest using [NameChecker](https://github.com/daniel11420/NameChecker) by [daniel11420](https://github.com/daniel11420).
It is Node.JS program that is available to dowload but is also available on repl.it and works rather well!
